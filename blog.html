        <p class="text1">I consider myself an artist as an artist is a person with the capacity to conceptualise 
            and produce artistic works. I have always loved to sketch and paint, and when my 
            mother discovered how talented I was, she encouraged me to turn my pastime into a 
            career. I painted and sketched everything you can imagine, including abstract pieces
             and everything from people to inanimate objects. <br> I'm passionate about capturing special moments that are dear to my heart when it comes to photography.<br> Art has a negative effect that not everyone can see, which is becoming an introvert;
             because of how much time I spend alone, it became difficult to interact with people.
             However, art also made it easier for me to work under pressure because it can be 
            difficult to finish an art piece in a specific amount of time.</p>
